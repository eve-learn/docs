# How to Create an Issue on GitHub

Welcome to our project! If you've encountered a problem or have a suggestion for improvement, creating an issue on GitHub is the best way to let us know. Follow these simple steps to create an issue:

## Step 1: Sign in to GitHub
If you don't already have a GitHub account, you'll need to sign up for one. It's free and only takes a few moments.

## Step 2: Navigate to the Repository
Go to the repository (project) where you want to create the issue. You can find our repository link in the project's README or on our website.

## Step 3: Click on the "Issues" Tab
Once you're in the repository, click on the "Issues" tab near the top of the page. This will take you to the issues section where you can see existing issues and create new ones.

## Step 4: Click on the "New Issue" Button
On the issues page, you'll see a green button labeled "New Issue." Click on this button to start creating your issue.

## Step 5: Describe Your Issue
In the issue creation form, you'll see a title field and a comment field. In the title, briefly describe the issue or suggestion you want to report. In the comment field, provide as much detail as possible about the problem or suggestion. You can also use formatting, like **bold** or *italic*, to make your issue description clear.

## Step 6: Add Labels and Assignees (If Applicable)
Below the comment field, you'll see options to add labels and assignees to your issue. Labels help categorize the issue (e.g., bug, enhancement, question), while assignees allow you to specify who is responsible for addressing the issue. If you're unsure, you can leave these fields blank.

## Step 7: Preview Your Issue (Optional)
Before submitting your issue, you can preview how it will look by clicking on the "Preview" tab above the comment field. This allows you to check for any formatting errors or typos.

## Step 8: Submit Your Issue
Once you're satisfied with your issue description, click on the "Submit new issue" button at the bottom of the page. Your issue will be created, and our team will review it as soon as possible.
